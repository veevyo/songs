# OPEN SOURCE MUSIC?!??!

You better believe it. These are songs written in Ruby using Sonic Pi. You can download them and import them into Sonic Pi and listen to the noises they make and maybe even export them into mp3s if you'd like! Or, even change them to sound the way you want them to sound. What have you.

And if this is something you're interested in, keep an eye out! I might even make changes to songs I've already uploaded here... The beauty of version control!
